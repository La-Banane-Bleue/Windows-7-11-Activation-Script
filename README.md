# Windows-7-11-Activation-Script
This script is designed to automate the process of activating Windows operating systems, ranging from Windows 7 to Windows 10. It uses Microsoft's default product keys to install the correct edition and activate Windows via a KMS (Key Management Service) server.

Key Features:
Automatic OS Detection: The script automatically detects whether the system is running Windows 7, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10.
Manual or Automatic Edition Detection: Users can choose between automatically detecting the Windows edition or selecting it manually.
Preconfigured KMS Server: The script automatically configures a predefined KMS server, and users cannot modify it.
Product Key Installation: The script installs the appropriate product key based on the detected or selected OS and edition.
Windows Activation: After the product key is installed, the script attempts to activate the OS via the preconfigured KMS server.
